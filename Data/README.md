# Data Folder

This folder contain all of the data used in this project. Subfolders are used for the various stages. 

The `Data` is being loaded/manipulated/reshaped/saved using code from the `Code` folder. 

## Raw Data

Do not edit Raw Data! It should be archived as you received it. It is the starting point, so do not change it. 

Any changes you need to make should be done in code, which is a natural archive of all of the steps you took. Following this practice will ensure that the data analysis pipeline is reproducible and documented. 

The raw data folder contains a data dictionary of the raw data

## Cleaned Data

`Processed_data` contains the cleaned version of the data. 
 
Cleaned data is saved as both CSV and RDS files

The cleaned data folder contains a data dictionary of the cleaned data
