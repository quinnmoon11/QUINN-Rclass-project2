# README.md

This folder contains the cleaned data for this project. We began with the data provided with the Palmerpenguins R package, which you can install in R using `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`

The cleaned data is stored as both a csv and rds files 
'processed data.csv'
'processed data.rds'

This dataset contains 16 columns as explained in `Quinndatadictionary.csv` or the table below. 

The cleaned data can be used for downstream analyses
 

Your first task is to find the faulty values and clean them, and save the cleaned dataset in `../Processed_data/`. Please save both `.rda` and `.csv` versions, and include a data dictionary in the `README.md`.  

The code for processing the raw data can be found in  **Project_template > Code > Processing_code**

The code for analyzing the cleaned will be placed in  **Project_template > Code > Analysis_code**
