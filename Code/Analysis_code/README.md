The Analysis_code folder contains the R and .qmd files needed to perform a simple analysis of the cleaned data by investigating three questions. The .qmd file is also rendered to html for easy viewing in a browser. 


`statistical_analysis.R` is an R script that does some simple statistical model fitting and plotting.

`exploratory_analysis.qmd` is a Quarto file that adds commentary to this analysis. The quarto file pulls in code from the R script, so that only one code file needs to be maintained. 

The figures and tables output by the analyses are saved in Results.
